# High-Low-Game
Week 14 of Udemy's 100 days of code Python bootcamp. The High-Low game project.

Note on the the game data: The data used was imported from the course. This is not my game data! If you see changes or errors, please make adjustments as you see fit. This was data that was provided. The only code that I implemented was the actual main program. The point is to enjoy the game and learn. If you are working on this project, the key is to make this big problem (the game) and break it down into much smaller problems. Each comment (for the most part) is a smaller problem I created out of the larger game. The double hashes (##) are actually sub-tasks of one of the higher problems (namely checking the player's answer). Feel free to play the game and test the code. Have fun!!!
